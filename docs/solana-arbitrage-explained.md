# Solana Arbitrage Explained

Solana arbitrage refers to the process of exploiting price differences across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Solana blockchain.

Arbitrage opportunities occur when the same token pair is priced differently across two or more markets. A bot monitors prices, calculates profitable routes, and executes trades when profitability surpasses the threshold.

## Common Arbitrage Types

### Two-Hop Arbitrage

A simple path:
Token A → Token B → Token A

If Token A sells for more through Token B on one DEX than it costs on another, a profit can be made.

### Triangle Arbitrage

A three-step cycle:
A → B → C → A

This route can uncover inefficiencies across multiple liquidity pools.

### Cross-DEX Arbitrage

Arbitrage captured by swapping tokens across multiple Solana DEXs such as Raydium, Orca, and Meteora.

## Why Solana Is Popular for Arbitrage

Solana’s blockchain provides:

- High throughput (thousands of transactions per second)
- Fast confirmation times
- Low transaction costs

These features make arbitrage opportunities appear rapidly and frequently.

However, competition is intense and success relies on execution speed, infrastructure quality, and real-time data.
